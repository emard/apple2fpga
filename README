This is a reconstruction of an 1980s-era Apple ][+ implemented in VHDL for
FPGAs.

------------------------------
The current implementation uses the Altera DE1/DE2 board and takes
advantage of its off-chip SRAM, VGA DAC, SD card, audio CODEC, and
PS/2 keyboard interface.

It was designed to be fairly easy to port: the apple2.vhd file should
be implementation-agnostic: it only assumes the external availability
of 48K of RAM and a keyboard.

It contains a simple read-only Disk II emulator that expects
"nibblized" disk images written raw onto an SD or MMC card (i.e., it
does not use a FAT or any other type of filesystem).

The VGA controller (not part of an original Apple) doubles each line
and interprets the Apple's NTSC-compatible color signals to produce a color
640 X 480 VGA display with non-standard dot timing.
------------------------------
To compile under Altera's Quartus software, open the
apple2fpga_DE1.qpf or apple2fpga_DE2.qpf project file and compile.

------------------------------
Disk images

The system expects a sequence of "nibblized" (227K) disk images on the
SD card starting at block 0.  Switches on the DE1/DE2 board selects
which image appears to be in the drive; the image number is displayed
in hex on two of the seven-segment displays.

Most Apple II disk images are in 140K .dsk files, which stores only
the disk's logical data, i.e., is not encoded.  dsk2nib.c is a small C
program that expands .dsk files to .nib files.

I used the "makenibs" script to find all the .dsk files in a tree of
directories, assemble them into an image suitable for downloading to
the SD card, and print an image number/file name cross-listing.

To write .nib images to an SD/MMC card under Linux, I use

dd if=dos33master.nib of=/dev/sdd

Of course, your card may appear as something other than /dev/sdd.

Under Windows, you can use dd.exe (http://www.chrysocome.net/dd):

dd.exe if=dos33master.nib of=\\?\Device\Harddiskx\Partition0

where the correct "Harddiskx" can be determined using the dd.exe
"--list" option:

dd.exe --list

------------------------------
ROMs

This archive does NOT include a copy of the Apple ][+'s ROMs, which
are copyright Apple Computer.  Instead, it includes a very trivial
BIOS that beeps, displays a text screen, then cycles through some
lores and hires graphics patterns when keys are pressed.  This should
be enough to verify the graphics, sound, and keyboard are working (but
not the disk emulator).  Source for this BIOS is in the bios.a65 file,
which I assembled using the xa65 cross-assembler.

The system requires two ROM images: a 12K image of the system roms
(memory from 0xD000 - 0xFFFF) and a 256-byte image of the Disk II
controller bootstrap ROM (memory from 0xc600 - 0xc6ff if the card is
in the usual slot 6).

Once you obtain them, run the "rom2vhdl" script to convert the binary
files into .vhd files that hold the data.  The Makefile contains rules
for doing this.
