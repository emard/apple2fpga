* OSD (on-screen display) video overlay soft core can display  
* ASCII character map over the video display by modifying VGA  
* pixel stream. In rectangular screen area, video content is   
* replaced with pixels coming from ASCII font, forming a       
* "window". This can be combined with a SPI slave receiver and 
* used to provide screen display for external CPU. For example,
* ESP32 micropython code can "print" on OSD screen. This method
* can be used to make SD card file selection menu.
